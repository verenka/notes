# notes
This was a project for my third semester at school. 
We had to create a web app like an address book where you can add notes to address book entries. 

I used javascript (jQuery), jQuery UI, HTML 5, CSS, ajax and php to create the address book. 
It lets you add, edit and delete users and notes and upload photos
